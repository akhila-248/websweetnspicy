            <p4>
                Paneer Tikka Masala Recipe is a quintessential dish of the North Indian cuisine. In this recipe the Paneer, the Indian Cottage cheese is flavored with a variety of spices including chaat masala to give it the additional punch.
                 I have also used the Coal Smoking Method  to give the Paneer Tikka Masala a tandoori flavor.
                 Serve the Paneer Tikka Masala along with a favorite Raita to me a complete dinner for your family.

<header2>Procedure</header2><br>
To begin making the Tandoori Paneer Tikka Masala Recipe, we will first make the tikka masala.<br>
In a bowl, combine the cream and chopped mint leaves.<br>
Pound the fennel seeds and ajwain and add it to the yogurt mixture. Add in the remaining tikka masala ingredients into the cream mixture and stir to combine well.<br>
Place the paneer cubes in a large bowl, add in the marinade and allow it to rest covered for about half an hour to one hour or even overnight.<br> 
Make a paste of the ginger and garlic using a pestle and mortar.<br>
Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan; add the pounded the ginger, garlic and saute for a few seconds. Add the tomatoes and give it a quick boil. Add the Paneer along with the marinade and give it a good stir to combine all the ingredients.<br>
Check the salt and spices and adjust to suit your taste. Cover the pan and allow the Paneer Tikka Masala to simmer for about 3 to 4 minutes.<br>
While simmering, we can prepare the coal for the coal smoking method.<br>
Take a piece or two of coal (about 3 inches big) and hold it over a gas flame with the help of tongs. The coal will begin to turn red hot and also grey in about 5 minutes.<br>
This indicates that the coal can be used for smoking. Place this hot coal inside a crack proof bowl. At this point heat a large wok or a skillet with rim that can be covered on medium heat.Place the coal along with the bowl over the paneer.<br>
Place the coal along with the bowl over the paneer tikka masala.<br>
Add a spoon of ghee or oil on the coal. It will begin to smoke. Immediately cover the pan and reduce the heat to low and let it sit for about a minute until the smoke has gone away. Open the lid and remove the coal cup.You dish will get a smoked flavored paneer that taste just like the Tandoori Paneer Tikka Masala.<br> 
Serve the Paneer Tikka Masala along with a favorite Indian Bread, Jeera Pulao, Papad and Raita to me a complete dinner for your family.<br>
