<header2>Procedure</header2><br>
<b>Masala dosa batter preparation:</b><br>
Firstly, in a large bowl take 3 cup sona masuri rice and ½ tsp methi.<br>
Rinse well and soak in enough water for 4 hours.<br>
In another bowl take 1 cup urad dal, 2 tbsp toor dal and 2 tbsp chana dal.<br>
Rinse well and soak in enough water for 2 hours.<br>
After soaking dal for 2 hours, drain off the water and transfer to the grinder. you can also grind in mixi if you do not have access to a grinder.<br>
Add water as required and blend to smooth paste.<br>
Scrape sides. the smooth and fluffy batter will be ready after 40 minutes.<br>
Transfer the batter to a large vessel and keep aside.<br>
In the same grinder add soaked rice and 1 cup rinsed poha.<br>
Add water slowly and scrape the sides. blend to a coarse paste.<br>
Transfer the rice batter to the same urad dal batter.<br>
Mix well making sure everything is well combined.<br>
Ferment in a warm place for at least 8 hours or until the batter doubles in volume. if you are leaving in a cold climate, then you can place the batter in the warm oven (just heat the oven until it turns slightly warm and then turn off) to ferment.<br>
Once the batter is well fermented, mix gently, without disturbing the air pockets.<br>
Transfer 4 cups of fermented batter to a small bowl and add 1 tsp salt.<br>
Mix well until the salt is well combined. masala dosa batter is ready. keep aside.<br>
